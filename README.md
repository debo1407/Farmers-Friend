**Project: Farmers_Friend – An Intelligent Multi-Agent Crop Advisory System**

Farmers_Friend is an AI-driven, multi-agent agricultural advisory system built using Google ADK and Gemini LLMs to provide personalized, real-time crop recommendations to Indian farmers. The system bridges the critical gap between accessible information and agronomic decision-making, especially for smallholder farmers operating under resource constraints.

At its core, the system utilizes a **modular multi-agent architecture**, where each specialized agent performs a dedicated task: fetching yield statistics, analyzing soil data, forecasting weather, retrieving government schemes, and valuating crop profitability. These agents collaborate to synthesize a holistic, data-informed recommendation pipeline that is both location- and season-specific.

A key innovation is the **critic-refiner loop**—an automated validation-feedback mechanism that scrutinizes each recommendation against a strict agronomic, economic, and practical checklist. If the generated output falls short (e.g., missing valuation or scheme), the system intelligently refines it, ensuring the final advice is both actionable and trustworthy.

The solution leverages **real-time data aggregation** via intelligent search queries targeting official Indian agriculture portals (IMD, ICAR, DAC, state govs), ensuring all recommendations are rooted in current climate patterns, local soil conditions, and active subsidy frameworks.

To enhance personalization and continuity, the system supports **memory persistence** across sessions—remembering user context like land size, crop preferences, and budget—to evolve and adapt recommendations over time.
Designed with **scalability and societal impact** in mind, Farmers_Friend empowers grassroots farmers with expert-level guidance without requiring technical literacy. It has potential use in agri-hotlines, rural mobile apps, and Krishi Vigyan Kendras.
